							<h2 class="">Why Masks Are Necessary, Even After A Successful Vaccine  </h2>
							<p>As we already know, COVID 19 virus has been rapidly increasing all over the globe. The number of positive cases has already reached 16.5 + million. To make peace with the situation, scientists and medical experts throughout the world are working at breakneck speed to develop a vaccine that can induce a strong immune system response against the novel coronavirus.  In total 155 + vaccines are in trial and 26 out of them have reached the human trial phase. Out of these only 5 vaccines have reached phase III or the last phase of clinical trials. These vaccines are being tried and tested upon thousands of people from different age groups to induce an immune system response to coronavirus. 

Having said all about the vaccines’ progress, it is important to wear masks even after we get a successful vaccine. Intrigued? Let’s know why? 

Since the vacancies have been developed in a speedy process to curb the further spread of coronavirus, one cannot be assured, if it is going to be fully functional in inducing a COVID ready immune system response. However, the vaccines will lower the chances of COVID 19 infection by improving the immune system in a particular way but cannot guarantee full security against the Novel Coronavirus. Only 60 to 70 percent of efficacy is provided by the vaccine when tested on people of all age groups

According to a report published in Science Insider, Maria Elena Bottazzi, a vaccine developer at Baylor College of Medicine said, “The moment you get a vaccine doesn't mean you're going to put your mask in the trash. That is not going to happen. I hope people don't think that is going to be the magic solution for all.” By stating this, he strongly implies that there will be a need to unerringly wear a mask to control the spread of virus. Apart from it, everybody cannot get the vaccine at the same time as the number of vaccines produced will be limited. In order to meet the equilibrium of demand and supply it will take a long time. So, wearing a mask is the only solution to combat coronavirus.  

Overall, one cannot rely solely on the vaccine to protect themselves from the contraction of Coronavirus and go back to the conventional old living style. Rather, we must follow a set of rules and regulations given by the Ministry of Health and Family Affairs and World Health Organisations to be at a position of lower risk of containing this virus. Some of them are as follows:

Always wear a mask before you set out from your home. 

Maintain social distancing of at least 6 feet.

Practice regular hand sanitization. 

Routinely clean and disinfect bins. 

We hope we soon get a vaccine which could make our immune system strong and COVID ready. And yet, prevention is always better than the cure. So, always keep your mask at your side. Thank you for reading!

							<h2 class="">Can Face Shields Be An Alternative To Masks</h2>
							<p>With the lockdown being phased out gradually, people are going back to their workplaces and routine. Those who do not have their own traveling conveniences are using public transportation to travel. Being in close proximity to others, they may carry a risk of infection. Many of us are looking for ways to protect ourselves in preparation for this. 
The usual steps of using sanitizers and social distancing can be maintained at home or in the office. But what will you do in a crowded bus where social distancing is not being followed properly? 

We all are aware of these grave situations and are actively looking for ways to protect themselves in public. Many people simply use a piece of cloth wrapped around their face, while some use face masks. Some people have also taken to using face shields. 
These have been usually worn in the medical field by surgeons, to stop fluids from getting to their faces during a surgery. The barrier it provides might make people tend to believe that it is a foolproof solution, as it blocks all fluids directed at the wearer’s face. But is a face shield enough? Can you do away with masks, if you are using a face shield? We don’t think so, neither do experts.

Face Shields offer a rigid protective barrier and cover the face from the forehead to the bottom of the chin. Being transparent, they are also convenient for the wearers. They offer protection against viral exposure from large droplets, approximately by 96% when worn within 18 inches of a cough. This is particularly useful in protecting the wearer’s eyes and may seem to be quite an attractive alternative for masks.

But it would be a mistake. Even while offering such a wide area of protection, face shields do not protect the wearer from all angles and from particles of microscopic sizes that include COVID 19 virus. This means that in the absence of a mask, small particles can easily reach the face shield wearer’s face. And also microbial particles escaping from the wearer are not filtered out, creating a public hazard. Dr. Frank Esper, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Cleveland Clinic Children's Center, states, “It (Face Shield) protects you the wearer. But if you cough because the face shield is away from your face, those droplets can still get out better than if you have a mask on.” 
As you can observe now, this poses a severe risk to both the wearer and others around.

Using a face shield is not enough to protect the wearer, just how utilizing a sanitizer by itself is not good enough. A proper face mask will still be necessary to protect against the dangers that are too small to be seen. It is vital that people choose one to wear, instead of wrapping a piece of cloth around their face for protection even while wearing a face shield. A proper face mask, like the N95 masks, can filter out more than 95% of microbial particles. 
If anything, face shields can only enhance the protection offered by a face mask, and not replace it.

							<h2 class="">5 Myths about Face Masks under the Microscope </h2>
							<p>Coronavirus has startled the world and put humanity out of its routine life. Now wearing a mask has become a necessity. According to Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases: “We can say very clearly that wearing a mask is definitely helpful in preventing acquisition as well as transmission.” 
Despite the facts stated now and then by experts, many of us are surrounded by myths related to wearing masks.

So, we have prepared this interesting piece to burst all the popular myths around masks, do that you always wear them comfortably. Let’s have a look:
</p>
							
                            							 
                            <h3>Myth 1:Oxygen levels will drop and carbon dioxide will be re-inhaled.</h3>
                            
                            
                            <p>Myth Buster 1:
Wearing a mask can be uncomfortable or unusual at times. But it doesn’t cause carbon dioxide intoxication or oxygen deficiency. It is observed that normal people can do an array of activities  while wearing masks. 
The World Health Organization has also shed some light on it. They have shared an infographic post that states “ The prolonged use of Medical masks* when properly worn, DOES not cause CO2 intoxication nor oxygen deficiency”. If one feels uneasy while wearing a mask then he/ she should limit his/her talking and breathe through the nose.”
</p>
						
						
						<h3>Myth 2: If you’re in good health, you don’t need a mask.</h3>
						
						<p>Myth Buster 2:
According to a study done in Italy, more than 40% of people tested positive for coronavirus had no symptoms. This meant that the virus was spreading silently. Most of the people were unaware of it because the symptoms cannot be easily detected in asymptomatic patients. So, in conclusion one might not find if he/she has symptoms of the virus but still could be infected. Only by wearing a mask can one prevent himself/herself from the virus.  
</p>


                            <h3>Myth 3:
A mask won’t stop the wearer from getting ill
</h3>
                                
                                <p>Myth Buster 3:
The main purpose of wearing a mask is to prevent the virus from spreading. Wearing a mask becomes more important in a public gathering or a crowded place because of the number of people. 
By wearing a mask one does not only protect himself/herself but also all the people around them. Masks catch droplets of moisture that may be acting as a transition medium for the virus. 
</p>
                                
                                <h3>Myth 4. 
If you have a medical condition, you don’t have to wear a mask.
</h3>
                                
                                <p>Myth Buster:
If someone is well enough to be in a public then he is well enough to wear a mask. 
People who are suffering from lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, hypertension etc. are more prone to this virus due to a weak immune system. So, they are advised to take all necessary precautions such as wearing masks, following social distancing, staying at home, and much more diligently. Choosing the right kind of mask for people with lifestyle diseases is the best way out of this situation.
</p>                                
                                
                        <h3>Myth 5:
It is enough to just wear a mask.
</h3>                                
                            <p>Myth Buster
Of course, it is not enough to just wear a mask. In order to protect from the virus, one needs to follow all the precautionary measures given by WHO. 
Social distancing and personal hygiene are important part of these measures.
